I am an undergraduate (final year) cyber security student at FAST National University Karachi, Pakistan.

My research interest lies within AI Security/AI for Security, Application Security, 
Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Assessment, and Exploit Development.

In addition, I enjoy playing Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and currently 
I am involved with team - pwnFAST

Occasionally, I blog and (try to) document things I learn and build so that 
I can reflect upon my journey (and maybe inspire fellow cyber security researchers).

### Selected Achievements


- *1st Place* - in the inter-university Capture the Flag (CTF) competition organized by DevDay'24 FAST NUCES Karachi

- *Top 10%* - AWS DeepRacer Student Nationals March 2023
